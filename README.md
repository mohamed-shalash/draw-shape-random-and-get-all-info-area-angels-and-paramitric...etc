## Overview

This project is a tool for drawing various shapes randomly and retrieving detailed information about them, including area, angles, and parametric details. It serves as a practical example for learning about geometry, random shape generation, and information extraction in programming.

## Features

- **Random Shape Generation**: Draws random shapes including triangles, rectangles, and other polygons.
- **Shape Information Extraction**: Provides detailed information such as area, angles, and parameters of the drawn shapes.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for generating and interacting with shapes.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/TypeScript for shape drawing and interaction
- HTML/CSS for user interface design
- Optional: Any additional libraries or frameworks used in the project

## Usage
1. Generate Random Shapes: Click the button or use the UI element to draw a random shape on the canvas.
2. View Shape Details: Information about the shape's area, angles, and other parameters will be displayed.
